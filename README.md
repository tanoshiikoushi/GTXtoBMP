# GTXtoBMP
Texture conversion tool for the Gamecube Release of Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 1.

Usage
===
To convert all the gtx files in a directory:
```
GTXtoBMP.exe -d "C:/path/to/directory/to/convert"
```


To convert a specific file:
```
GTXtoBMP.exe -f "C:/path/to/file.gtx"
```


Log File
===
log.txt alongside the executable will contain a bunch of not useful information unless you're curious about the batch conversion.
Just check that no errors occurred by searching for `!!!`.
No results means everything worked perfectly :)
